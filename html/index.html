                Welcome to this tutorial on how to prepare Pounded Yam and Egusi
                Soup
            </p>

                <h2>About Egusi Soup</h2>
                <p>
                    Egusi soup is a popular Nigerian soup made with ground melon
                    seeds and vegetables. It is usually served with pounded yam,
                    a starchy side dish made from yam.
                </p>
                <p>To make egusi soup, you will need:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ground egusi seeds</li>
                    <li>Assorted meats (beef, goat meat, chicken, etc.)</li>
                    <li>
                        Assorted vegetables (spinach, bitter leaf, pumpkin
                        leaves, etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li>Fish, crayfish</li>
                    <li>Seasoning cubes</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>Pepper</li>
                    <li>Onions</li>
                    <li>Palm oil</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To make the soup, heat the palm oil in a large pot over
                    medium heat. Add the onions and fry until translucent. Add
                    the ground egusi and fry for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
                    Add the chicken or beef stock and stir to combine. Add the
                    cooked meat or fish, salt, crayfish, and pepper. Add
                    seasoning cubes and salt. Cover and let simmer for 10
                    minutes. Add the spinach or pumpkin leaves and stir to
                    combine. Let cook for an additional 5 minutes, or until the
                    leaves are wilted. Serve with pounded yam.

                <h2>About Pounded Yam</h2>
                <p>
                    Pounded yam is a staple food in many African countries,
                    including Nigeria. It is made by boiling yam and then
                    pounding it until it becomes a smooth, stretchy dough-like
                    consistency. It is usually served with soups and stews, such
                    as egusi soup.
                </p>
                <p>To make pounded yam, you will need:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yam</li>
                    <li>Water</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To make the pounded yam, peel and cut the yam into small
                    pieces. Put the yam pieces in a pot and add water to cover.
                    Let cook until the yam is soft, about 15-20 minutes. Drain
                    the water and put the yam in a mortar. Use a pestle to pound
                    the yam until it becomes smooth and stretchy. Serve with
                    egusi soup.
